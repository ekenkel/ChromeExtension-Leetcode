# ChromeExtension-Leetcode
 
## Overview

This Chrome Extension is a tool designed to enhance the interview preparation experience by removing distracting elements from Leetcode, creating a focused environment for problem-solving practice.

## Features

- **Element Removal:** Automatically hides elements such as difficulty indicators, if you have solved the problem before, and like counts.
  
- **Toggle Button:** Provides a toggle button to reveal or hide the hidden elements, allowing users to switch between a focused environment and a detailed view.

## Motivation

### The Problem

During the process of preparing for technical interviews, external factors such as problem difficulty, indicators if the problem has been completed before, and community feedback can unintentionally influence the way an individual approaches a coding problem.

### The Solution

This Chrome Extension aims to address this issue by providing a streamlined and distraction-free environment for users to engage with coding problems, fostering a more authentic interview experience.

## How It Works

The extension utilizes a Mutation Observer to dynamically detect and hide specific elements on Leetcode. This ensures that distracting information is removed before the page is displayed.
